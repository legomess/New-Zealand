      <h2>A Short History of New Zealand</h2>

      <h3>The Māori People</h3>
      <p>The Māori were the first people to arrive in New Zealand, traveling by canoe from Polynesia over 700 years ago. They developed a unique way of life, living in close connection with nature. Māori had strong beliefs, rich art, and told stories through carvings and songs. Their language, Te Reo Māori, is still spoken today.</p>

      <h3>European Exploration</h3>
      <p>The first European to see New Zealand was Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, but he did not land. In 1769, British Captain James Cook explored the islands and created maps that helped more ships reach New Zealand. Soon after, European settlers and missionaries began arriving, bringing new tools, animals, and religion.</p>

      <h3>The Treaty of Waitangi</h3>
      <p>In 1840, the British signed a treaty with many Māori chiefs. It was called the Treaty of Waitangi. This agreement made New Zealand a British colony, but it also promised to protect Māori land and traditions. Today, the treaty is still very important in New Zealand law and is seen as the foundation of the country’s government and culture.</p>

      <h3>New Zealand Becomes a Nation</h3>
      <p>New Zealand became more independent over time. It got its own parliament and made its own laws. In 1947, it became fully independent from Britain. The country grew into a modern democracy with a strong economy, good education, and health care. It is also a leader in protecting nature and promoting equality for all people.</p>
